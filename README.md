# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains:

* Data analysis and ML projects ocompleted for personal interest on my Substack
* Data analysis projects completed as part of the Data Analyst Bootcamp Course (Cambridge Spark)
* Data analysis final project for Code First Girls Course 

Note: Data Analysis is also included as an essential part of machine learning and deep learning models and as such is also included under the other repositories in this portfolio
